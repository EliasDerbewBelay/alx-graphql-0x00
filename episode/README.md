# 📺 Episode Query – ALX GraphQL Project

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this task is to practice writing a **GraphQL query** to fetch the details of a specific episode from the **Rick and Morty GraphQL API** using its ID.

---

## 🔍 Instructions

Use the `episode(id: ID!)` field to retrieve episode information.

The query should return the following fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `air_date`
- `episode`

Save the query in a `.graphql` file and the result in a `.json` file.
