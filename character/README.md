# Character GraphQL Query

This project demonstrates how to query the Rick and Morty GraphQL API to retrieve a character’s information by ID.

**Endpoint:**

Each `.graphql` file contains a query for one character (IDs 1–4), and the corresponding `.json` file contains the output from running that query.

**Queried fields:**

- id
- name
- status
- species
- type
- gender
